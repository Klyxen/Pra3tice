### Phone Number Information Finder

This Python script provides information about a phone number, including the country, carrier, and timezone associated with it. It uses multiple libraries to parse the phone number, find the country, identify the carrier, and even determine the timezone of the country where the phone number is registered.

## Features:
- **Phone Number Validation**: Validates the phone number and returns information such as country and carrier.
- **Internet Connection Check**: Verifies if the system is connected to the internet before fetching data.
- **Geolocation**: Retrieves the country location of the phone number and uses that data to find the timezone.
- **Timezone Detection**: Uses geolocation data to detect the timezone for the given country.

## Requirements:

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the script:
- `phonenumbers` - For parsing phone numbers and retrieving carrier and country information.
- `geopy` - For geolocation and country-based lookup.
- `timezonefinder` - For timezone lookup based on geographical coordinates.
- `colorama` - For colored terminal output.
- `socket` - For checking internet connectivity.

You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:
```bash
pip install phonenumbers geopy timezonefinder colorama
